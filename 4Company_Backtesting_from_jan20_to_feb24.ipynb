    "\n",
    "1) Prompt for inputs — ask for input Excel path, output Excel path, INVESTMENT (float), COMBO_SIZE (int), OBSERVATION_DAYS (int), MONTH_ROLLING (months to skip), ROLL_TYPE (year/month/week/day) and INCREMENT (integer step).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Load Excel — read the input file into a DataFrame and strip column name whitespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Detect date column — auto-find the first column whose name contains \"date\", parse it to datetime (day-first), drop invalid dates and sort rows by date.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Detect company columns — treat every other numeric column as a company price series and build company_names.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Compute start date — set start_date = earliest date + MONTH_ROLLING months; set current to the first day of that month. Print dataset start and processing start.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Rolling-step helper — get_next_date(current) advances current by INCREMENT units according to ROLL_TYPE (year/month/week/day).\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Open Excel writer — create an openpyxl ExcelWriter to save results into multiple sheets inside the specified output_file.\n",
    "\n",
    "8) Main rolling loop — while current is ≤ last date in data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* set observe_start = current and observe_end = current + OBSERVATION_DAYS.\n",
    "\n",
    "* slice data into the observation window; if empty, advance current using get_next_date and continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "9) Pick calculation date — for a non-empty window, choose the earliest date inside it (selected_date) and take that row as the price reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "10) Generate combinations — iterate all combinations of COMBO_SIZE companies from company_names.\n",
    "\n",
    "11) Compute quantities — for each combo, compute INVESTMENT / price for each company (round to 2 decimals). If price is NaN or 0, put \"NA\".\n",
    "\n",
    "12) Assemble results — collect rows as [Combo (comma list), Quantities (comma list), Calculation_Date] and form a DataFrame out_df.\n",
    "\n",
    "13) Write sheet — write out_df to the Excel writer as a sheet named YYYY-MM (from current).\n",
    "\n",
    "14) Advance roll — update current = get_next_date(current) and repeat until past the last date.\n",
    "\n",
    "15) Finish — close the writer (file saved) and print success message with the output file path."

    "\n",
    "1) Prompt for inputs — ask user for: price Excel path, combo quantity Excel path, output folder, OBS_DAYS (observation window in days), ROLL_TYPE (day/week/month/year) and ROLL_VALUE (increment). Create the output folder if missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Load price data — read the price Excel into df_price. Treat the first column as the date column and the rest as company price columns. Parse the date column to datetime and sort by date.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Skip first 3 months — compute skip_date = first_date + 3 months and keep only rows after this date in df_filtered. Print the original start and post-skip date.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Load combo data — read the combo Excel into df_combo, strip header whitespace, and split the Combo string into C1..C4 columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Parse quantities — convert the Quantities string into numeric Q1..Q4 using split_qty, filling missing or invalid entries with 0.0 and ensuring exactly 4 values.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Pre-map company indices — create col_index mapping each company column name to its integer index and convert C1..C4 into a combo_indices integer matrix (use -1 for missing companies).\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Build quantity matrix — create qty_matrix as a numeric (float) array containing the four quantities per combo.\n",
    "\n",
    "8) Helper to shift date — shift_date(start, roll_type, value) advances a date by the requested rolling frequency (day, week, month, year) and increment value.\n",
    "\n",
    "9) Initialize rolling loop — set current_start to the earliest date in df_filtered and start window_count = 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "10) Define observation window — each iteration sets window_end = current_start + OBS_DAYS - 1 and selects rows between current_start and window_end into df_window. If empty, the loop breaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "11) Prepare vectorized price matrix — convert df_window[company_cols] to a NumPy array df_prices_np for fast numeric operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "12) Vectorized per-row combo pricing — for each date row (vectorized by iterating rows of df_prices_np):\n",
    "\n",
    "* extract all combo prices at once using price_matrix = dp_row[combo_indices] (with -1 replaced by 0),\n",
    "\n",
    "* compute total_prices = sum(price_matrix * qty_matrix, axis=1) to get total combo price for every combo in one go.\n",
    "\n",
    "13) Collect results quickly — append rows [DATE, Combo, Price_Combo (list), Total_Price] for every combo and update the tqdm progress bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "14) Save window CSV — after processing the window, convert results to df_result and save it as Window_{n}_{OBS_DAYS}Days.csv in the output folder. Print the saved filename.\n",
    "\n",
    "15) Advance rolling window — update current_start = shift_date(current_start, ROLL_TYPE, ROLL_VALUE), increment window_count, and repeat until current_start exceeds the dataset end.\n",
    "\n",
    "16) Finish — when done, print a final success message: all rolling CSV files generated."

    "1) Prompt user for inputs — ask for the input folder containing price CSVs, the EURINR Excel file path, output folder, and the moving-average window MOVING_AVG_DAYS. Create the output folder if missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Load FX (EURINR) series — read the EURINR Excel (DATE, EURINR), convert DATE to datetime, and set it as the index for fast joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Discover input CSV files — find and sort all *.csv files in the input price folder and print the count.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Loop over each input CSV file — for every file create an output filename prefixed with the DMA window (e.g., 50DMA_...).\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Prepare rolling state per combo — create two structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ratio_queue: a defaultdict of deque(maxlen=MOVING_AVG_DAYS) to hold the last N ratio values per combo.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ratio_sum: a defaultdict(float) to keep the running sum per combo (so you can compute the average quickly).\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Stream the CSV in chunks — read the large CSV file with pd.read_csv(..., chunksize=50000) selecting only DATE, Combo, Total_Price and parsing DATE. A progress bar (tqdm) shows progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Join FX into each chunk — for each chunk, join the fx table on DATE to attach the matching EURINR value; drop rows where EURINR is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "8) Compute EURINR ratio per row — calculate eur_ratio = Total_Price / EURINR as a NumPy array for the chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "9) Compute rolling DMA per combo — iterate rows in the chunk:\n",
    "\n",
    "* For each row’s Combo, maintain its deque and ratio_sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the deque is full, subtract the oldest value from ratio_sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Append the new ratio, add it to ratio_sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compute DMA = ratio_sum[combo] / len(deque) and store it.\n",
    "\n",
    "10) Assemble output chunk — build a DataFrame with DATE, Combo, EURINR_Ratio, and the computed {MOVING_AVG_DAYS}DMA_EURINR.\n",
    "\n",
    "11) Append to output CSV — write the chunk to the output file in append mode; write header only for the first chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "12) Repeat until file complete — loop through all chunks for the file. After finishing, print the created output path.\n",
    "\n",
    "13) Process all files — repeat steps 4–12 for every input CSV discovered.\n",
    "\n",
    "14) Finish — when all files are processed, print a final success message."

    "1) Prompt for inputs — ask user for: input price folder, NIFTY Excel file, output folder, and MOVING_AVG_DAYS. Create output folder if missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Load NIFTY series — read DATE and NIFTY from the Excel file, convert DATE to datetime, and set it as the DataFrame index for fast joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Find input CSVs — list and sort all *.csv files in the input price folder and print the count.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Loop over each CSV file — for each price CSV, build an output filename prefixed with the DMA window (e.g., 50DMA_NIFTY_filename.csv).\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Prepare rolling state per combo — create:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ratio_queue: defaultdict of deque(maxlen=MOVING_AVG_DAYS) to store last N ratio values per combo, and\n",
    "\n",
    "* ratio_sum: defaultdict(float) to hold running sums for fast average computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Stream the CSV in chunks — read the CSV in chunks (chunksize=50000) selecting DATE, Combo, Total_Investment. A tqdm progress bar shows progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Join NIFTY values into chunk — join the nifty table on DATE (left join) and drop rows without a matching NIFTY.\n",
    "\n",
    "8) Compute per-row ratio — compute nifty_ratio = Total_Investment / NIFTY for the chunk as a NumPy array.\n",
    "\n",
    "9) Initialize DMA array — create a zero dma_values array to store the moving average for each row in the chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "10) Per-row rolling average update — for each row’s Combo:\n",
    "\n",
    "* fetch its deque q;\n",
    "\n",
    "* if q is full, subtract the oldest value from ratio_sum[combo];\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* compute dma_values[i] = ratio_sum[combo] / len(q).\n",
    "\n",
    "11) Assemble output chunk — build a DataFrame with DATE, Combo, NIFTY_Ratio, and {MOVING_AVG_DAYS}DMA_NIFTY.\n",
    "\n",
    "12) Append to output CSV — write the output chunk to the CSV in append mode; only write the header for the first chunk (header_written flag).\n",
    "\n",
    "13) Repeat until file complete — continue processing chunks until the CSV is exhausted, then print the saved output path.\n",
    "\n",
    "14) Process all files — repeat steps 4–13 for every input CSV file found.\n",
    "\n",
    "15) Finish — when all files are done print the final success message."
